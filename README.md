## projet-c-wire
C-wire is a data synthesis and processing project designed to enable rapid consultation of a database representing 1/4 of the French electricity network.

## üõ†Ô∏è Roadmap
- sort the database in shell then send it to a C program.
- calculate in C how much energy passing through each station to determine which stations are overpowered. We use an **AVL** for optimized performance, thanks to a better complexity.
- the shell retake the results, displays them and creates a graph.

## üß∞ Skills required
- C
- shell
- gnuplot library
